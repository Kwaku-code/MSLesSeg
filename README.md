This study explores the use of Deep Learning algorithms for the task of Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation. The model used in this study follows the Unet Architecture with Efficientb0, DeanseNet121 and ResNet34 as the backbones. The Unet employed is as defined in the Tensorflow Segmentation Models of https://segmentation-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html. We work with 2D slices of 3D MRIs and stack their predictions back together to obtain same spatial resolutions (182,218,182) of the ground truths used during training.
